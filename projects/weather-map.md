![Final weather map](/projects/weather-map/weathermap.jpg)

## Description ##

An LED placed at each of the fifty state capitals updates its color every 20 minutes over the internet to reflect the current temperature in that city. The legend on the right side indicates what temperature each color corresponds to.

## Background ##

I was contracted by my local makerspace, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextfab.com/">NextFab</a>, to build an Internet of Things (IoT) project that would encourage members to take classes on and learn more about IoT. I wanted to create something that would feel novel and exciting, yet be open ended enough to inspire variations or additions. Visualizing weather data with LEDs was a fun way to accomplish this goal. The map now hangs in the front lobby at NextFab.

## Instructional Guide ##

At the end of the project, all of the files were open sourced and made available to the public. Download the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/projects/weather-map/BBBWeatherVisualizerInstructions.pdf">how-to guide</a> as a PDF.
